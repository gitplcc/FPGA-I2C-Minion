* Write a common TB library for i2c master code
* "read_stop" state
- Do we need the read_stop state?
- Why don't we go straight to "idle"?

* Checking for the START state at the end of the main loop
- Can we have a START before a STOP?
#+BEGIN_SRC vhdl
  --------------------------------------------------------
  -- Reset counter and state on start/stop
  --------------------------------------------------------
  if start_reg = '1' then
    state_reg          <= get_address_and_cmd;
    bits_processed_reg <= 0;
  end if;
#+END_SRC

* Add tests for interrupted transmission
- Stop a transmission in between, check all bits

* Should I add read_busy, write_busy signals?
- will save us 1 clock cycle latency
- see VCT labs code with read_done, write_done signals
